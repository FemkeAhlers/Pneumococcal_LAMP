## Abstract of upcoming publication
Highly sensitive and specific diagnostics are a cornerstone to the global surveillance of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (pneumococcus). Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays provide a rapid, accurate, accessible and cost-effective method for the identification of nucleic acids. Here, we established a LAMP assay targeting the pneumococcal putative GntR-family transcriptional regulator SP2020, and exploited large genomic datasets to assess its performance *in silico*, before *in vitro* validation. We designed five LAMP primer sets, with loop primers for one of them, creating six LAMP primer combinations, and performed real-time detection with SYBR green. LAMP assay SP2020_3+ had the fastest reaction time and was taken forward. Simulating SP2020_3+ primer binding *in silico*, we found a positivity rate of 99.6% (CI95% 99.4-99.7%) in a dataset of 7,547 diverse pneumococcal genomes and a positivity rate of 0.1% (CI95% 0.0-0.3%) in a dataset of 1,825 genomes of 55 non-pneumococcal *Streptococcus* species (caused by a single *Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae* genome). We then tested the LAMP assay *in vitro* on three panels. First, we found a sensitivity of 100% (CI95% 98.5-100%) on 246 surveillance pneumococci from the United Kingdom Health Security Agency. Second, no cross-reactivity was found testing a panel of 277 isolates of 21 non-pneumococcal *Streptococcus* species, resulting in a specificity of 100% (CI95% 98.7-100%). Third, we tested a SP2020 diversity panel, finding that SP2020_3+ performed well across 71 unique SP2020 alleles. The SP2020_3+ LAMP assay could consistently detect down to 65 pneumococcal genome copies per 25 Î¼L reaction volume in three independent dilution series. This highly sensitive and specific LAMP assay could benefit low-resource settings in the identification of pneumococci.
